After provisioning my infrastrucure, i tried to create the eks cluster using terraform PLAN first and got the error below 
 terraform plan
╷
│ Error: Invalid depends_on reference

│   97:   depends_on = [aws_eks_cluster_auth.pythonapp_cluster.name]

SOLUTION
The error message you received indicates that you are using the depends_on attribute with an incorrect reference. In Terraform, the depends_on attribute should reference a resource object 
and (aws_eks_cluster_auth) is not a RESOURCE object


I got another error while creating the worker nodes, it needed subnet ids and i referenced only the private id of subnet but it didnt fix it 
so i referenced both private and public subnets and ran terraform plan again and it worked
